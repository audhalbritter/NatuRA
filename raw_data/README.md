# Raw Data

This folder contains raw, unprocessed data files for the NatuRA project.

## Contents

Store all original, unmodified data files in this directory. Raw data should be:
- Kept in its original format as received or collected
- Never modified directly
- Treated as read-only to preserve data integrity

Data processing scripts should read from this folder and write outputs to the `clean_data` folder.
