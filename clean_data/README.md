# Clean Data

This folder contains processed and cleaned data files for the NatuRA project.

## Contents

Store all cleaned, processed, and analysis-ready data files in this directory. Clean data files are:
- Derived from raw data through processing scripts
- Formatted and structured for analysis
- The output of data cleaning and transformation operations

Processing scripts in the `R` folder should read from `raw_data` and write cleaned data here.
